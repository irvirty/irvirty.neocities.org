When there are a lot of things on the site, then you start thinking about the structure: different folders for different things, and all this needs to be called somehow, and this is part of SEO.

<title><![CDATA[Update:
===
1. Added a tag editing button (function) for the tags list (explore panel) on the main page; tags are stored locally in the browser.
